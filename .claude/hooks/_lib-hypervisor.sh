# _lib-hypervisor.sh — shared helpers for the Hypervisor compaction hooks
# (pre-compact-hypervisor-checkpoint.sh, session-start-hypervisor-reanchor.sh).
# Design: .claude/hooks/README.md (Hypervisor compaction) + .claude/plan-coordination/README.md (wiring + file ownership).
#
# SOURCED, never executed — the leading "_" marks a library, per
# .claude/hooks/README.md ("Files prefixed with _ are libraries").
#
# IDENTITY IS ASSERTED POSITIVELY BY OWNER-SESSION-ID, NOT BY AN INHERITABLE VAR.
# A dispatched child inherits its parent's environment, so gating on an exported
# `HYPERVISOR_PLAN_DIR` would mis-identify every child as the Hypervisor. The markers are
# instead session-private files under a PER-SESSION subdir `<cwd>/.hypervisor/<session_id>/`
# (so MULTIPLE Hypervisors in the SAME cwd never clobber each other): `role` holds
# "hypervisor <owning-session-id>" and a hook acts ONLY when its own stdin session_id both
# (a) names the subdir it reads and (b) matches that owner (see __hypervisor_is_hv). The
# per-session subdir is the primary isolation; the owner-match is defense-in-depth (a
# crashed session's stale subdir carries a dead id no live session reads or matches). A
# child runs with its OWN session dir (the Child-spawn contract sets CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to
# the child + strips HYPERVISOR_PLAN_DIR), so it never sees the parent's marker — and even
# if it did, its session_id differs in both the path and the owner.
#
# Every helper is a READ-ONLY probe with a no-op default; the hooks act ONLY when
# the marker is present and NEVER fail a compaction because tooling is absent.

# __hypervisor_dir [cwd] -> the base dir whose .hypervisor/ we consult — matches where the
# statusline and INITIALIZE write: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, else the passed cwd, else $PWD.

# __hypervisor_session_dir <session_id> [cwd] -> the PER-SESSION marker dir
# `<cwd>/.hypervisor/<session_id>/`, the session-private home of role/plan-dir/self-ctx/
# session-id. Scoping by session_id is what lets MULTIPLE Hypervisors share ONE cwd without
# clobbering each other. Degraded fallback: an EMPTY session_id (older CLI that does not emit
# one) collapses to the flat `<cwd>/.hypervisor/` — single-session behaviour, no isolation.

# __hypervisor_is_hv <session_id> [cwd] -> exit 0 iff THIS session is the Hypervisor.
# Reads no inheritable env var for the identity decision. The marker is
# `<cwd>/.hypervisor/<session_id>/role` containing "hypervisor <owning-session-id>"
# (INITIALIZE stamps the owner = its own $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID). TWO layers: the
# PER-SESSION subdir means a hook only ever reads its OWN session's role, and the
# OWNER-MATCH then requires the recorded owner to equal the hook's stdin session_id. A
# crashed (un-HALTed) Hypervisor leaves a subdir named by its DEAD session id that no live
# session reads (different id -> different path) AND whose owner no live session matches, so
# it is doubly inert — a later session in the same checkout is NEVER mis-identified, no
# liveness epoch needed. (The live-helper leak — a child that inherits CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR —
# is closed separately by the Child-spawn contract that gives every child its OWN dir.)
# Degraded fallback: an EMPTY session_id collapses to the flat dir and an EMPTY owner falls
# back to existence-gating — functional but identity-weak and NOT multi-session-safe; the
# Bootstrap Gate asserts the statusline emits session-id so the subdir+owner are normally set.
