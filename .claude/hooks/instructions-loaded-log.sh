# InstructionsLoaded hook: log which CLAUDE.md files were auto-loaded.
#
# Fires AFTER Claude Code auto-loads the layered CLAUDE.md system at session
# start / on directory entry. Per https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks this
# is the recommended observability hook for the memory system; the input JSON
# carries the list of loaded files so we can answer "why didn't this rule
# fire?" by replaying the loaded set after the fact.
#
# Output: one CSV-ish line per invocation appended to a per-project log file
# at $XDG_STATE_HOME/claude/instructions-loaded/<project-slug>.log (default:
# ~/.local/state/claude/instructions-loaded/<project-slug>.log).
#
# Why per-project: the previous `/tmp/claude-instructions-loaded.log` path
# interleaved every project on the machine into one file, making per-session
# replay useless. Namespacing by basename of cwd separates streams.
#
# Pure observability: exits 0 always. Never blocks. Silent on jq absence.
